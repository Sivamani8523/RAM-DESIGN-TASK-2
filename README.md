To design and simulate a simple synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) module using Verilog HDL, allowing read and write operations with proper clock control and testbench verification.

Verilog HDL

ModelSim / Vivado / any other simulation tool (specify which)

Testbench for functional verification


Design Description:

The RAM module is designed as a synchronous memory unit that stores data in an array of registers. It supports write and read operations based on control signals and operates on the rising edge of the clock
